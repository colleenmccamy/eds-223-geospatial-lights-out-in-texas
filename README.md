# Lights Out in Texas
Identifying homes affected by the Texas energy crisis

### introduction
In February 2021, the state of Texas was in a state of crisis when unusual winter storms left millions without power. Power outages pose an extra threat to customers who those who are medically vulnerable and marginalized groups and historically divested groups may be disproportionately impacted. 1

This blog post highlights an initial investigation estimating the number of homes in the Houston metropolitan area that lost power as a result of the first two storms and exploring if socioeconomic factors are predictors of outage areas.

The goal of the investigation was to practice using spatial data and associated functions and packages. Further investigation is needed to answer the questions explored in this practice and this investigationâ€™s limitations are outlined in the conclusion section.
